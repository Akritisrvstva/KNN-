K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
K-Nearest Neighbors

This repository contains an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier, a simple yet effective machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. KNN is a non-parametric algorithm that makes predictions based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Introduction
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. Given a new data point, it identifies its k nearest neighbors based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) and assigns a label to the data point based on the majority class of its neighbors. KNN is a lazy learner, meaning it does not explicitly build a model during the training phase. Instead, it memorizes the entire dataset to make predictions during the testing phase.

Installation
To use the K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can install this package using pip:
